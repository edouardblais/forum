# About

Welcome to my forum app! 

Create a user and then contribute to existing topics within communities
or create a new topic (and/or community!) to start a new discussion!

# Techno

Built with Node.js and Express, with Pug a the template engine.

The database used to store the users and general forum info is MongoDB.

It will be soon hosted on Railway and probably styled with Bootstrap.

This app is also my first attempt at using Typescript!
